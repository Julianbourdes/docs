## Planning Poker

Run effective estimation sessions with your team.

### Vote Together, Decide Faster

Start a session and share your unique code. Your team joins instantly and votes at the same time. See results the moment everyone's voted.

### Estimation Decks That Work for You

Choose the estimation scale that fits your team:
- **Fibonacci** - Classic agile estimation (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13...)
- **T-Shirt Sizes** - Simple sizing (XS, S, M, L, XL)
- **Powers of 2** - Technical estimates (1, 2, 4, 8, 16...)
- **Custom Decks** - Create your own values and save for reuse

### Connect Your Jira Workspace

Import stories straight from Jira:
- Browse your projects and pick the stories you need
- Filter by issue type, status, or assignee
- Estimates sync back to Jira automatically when you're done

### Organize Your Sessions

- **Unique Join Codes** - Share a simple 6-character code to invite anyone
- **Session Archive** - Access past sessions anytime
- **Voting Options** - Choose anonymous voting, auto-reveal, or show cards as you vote
- **Voting Timers** - Set time limits to keep sessions moving

### Keep Everyone Engaged

- **Role Management** - Assign hosts, participants, and spectators
- **Live Updates** - See who's voted and who's still deciding
- **Anonymous Mode** - Hide individual votes until everyone's ready
- **Spectator View** - Let stakeholders observe without voting

## Work With Your Team

### Manage Multiple Organizations

Switch between different companies or departments from one account. Each organization keeps its own teams, sessions, and settings.

### Invite Your Team

Send email invitations to colleagues. They'll choose how to sign in when they join.

### Assign the Right Roles

- **Organization Admins** manage settings and team members
- **Team Leads** create and run estimation sessions
- **Members** participate and collaborate

## Sign In Securely

### Choose Your Preferred Login

Pick what works for you:
- **Google** - Sign in with your Google account
- **Microsoft** - Use your Microsoft 365 credentials
- **GitHub** - Connect with GitHub

### Link Multiple Accounts

Connect Google, Microsoft, and GitHub to the same Teamova account. Switch between them anytime.

### Set a Backup Password

Even if you signed up with Google, Microsoft, or GitHub, you can add a password for an alternative way to sign in.

## Language Options

Use Teamova in your language:
- **English** - Full interface in English
- **Français** - Complete French version

Switch between languages in your account settings.
